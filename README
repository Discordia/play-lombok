This module adds Lombok to Play! so you can use all the the Lombok annotations and 'val' keyword in your Play! app.

To install it you can download the zip file and unzip it to your modules directory under your Play! installation.

Then add this to your dependencies.yml
   - play -> lombok 0.10.0-RC1

This has been tested with Play! 1.2 and 1.2.1

You will still need to install Lombok in your IDE, if you are using one.
